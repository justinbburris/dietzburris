        <h3>Justin Burris</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">
          Born in Germany, the U.S. Army moved Justin and his parents from city to city until
          kindergarten, when they settled in middle Georgia. There he came to have a love for computers, music and reading.
          Justin is now a software engineer by day and an explorer of new adventures by night.</p>
        <p class="text-muted">
          Justin has a younger brother, Zach and five step siblings, Kyle, Brett, Jessie, Juanita and Nicolas.
          He tolerates Oxy and spends his time working on making an awesome life together with Stephanie.
